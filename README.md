## Organic Synthesis Study Guide

These notes are a summary of the organic synthesis unit of the Organic Chemistry II (CHEM-231) at Amherst College for the spring 2012 term. I created these notes both to help myself and others better understand and centralize the tools available for organic synthesis.

The notes are split into two files:
 * ***brief*** provides an overview of various retrosynthetic patterns and summarizes the rules for organic synthesis. 
 * ***study-guide*** contains detailed mechanisms, reagents, conditions, and considerations for each reaction. 

These notes cover four major areas of synthetically useful organic reactions:

1. Alkane Substitution Reactions
2. Alkene Addition Reactions
3. Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution Reactions
4. Carbonyl Chemistry
